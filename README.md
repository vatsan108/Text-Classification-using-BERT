# Text-Classification-using-BERT
This repository demonstrates a complete pipeline for text classification using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The model is built with the Hugging Face transformers library and fine-tuned on a classification task. It can be adapted for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, or topic categorization.

Features
Pre-trained BERT (bert-base-uncased) with a classification head.
Tokenization and data preparation using Hugging Face tokenizers.
Optimized training loop with AdamW optimizer and learning rate scheduler.
Training and evaluation on a labeled dataset (e.g., IMDb, custom datasets).
GPU support for faster training.

Workflow
Load Dataset: Prepare and tokenize text data for BERT.
Model Setup: Load a pre-trained BERT model with a classification head.
Training: Fine-tune the model on a classification dataset.
Evaluation: Test the model's accuracy on unseen data.
Save and Export: Save the fine-tuned model for inference.
